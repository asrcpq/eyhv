Still in its early development stage

## Features

---

* Minimalism design

* Randomly generated and reproducible enemies

## TODO

### Implementation

---

* [x] Moving

* [x] Restrict position

* [x] Slowdown

* [x] Color and transparency

* [x] Antialiasing

* [x] World slowdown with transition

* [x] Simple cannon & simple bullet

* [x] Enemy path and graphics

* [x] Simple collision test with position(not tested!)

* [x] Collision box for enemy and player bullet(lineseg\_distance function)

* [x] Enemy cannon

* [x] Reproducible randomize cannon and bullet param(Framework)

* [x] Wave generator and wave manager
(add 1 wave type contains of 1 type of enemy with 1 type of cannon)

* [x] Player collision box

* Add more contents

	* [ ] New Cannon: Rotor with new bullet: RotateBullet

* [ ] simple\_try random generator optimization with monotonicity

* [ ] Game mechanism

* [ ] Visual effects

### Coding

---

* [ ] Generalize tick() by using signal like methods

* [ ] Fine-grained inter-module visibility

* [ ] Using reference instead of cloning everything everywhere(necessary?)

* [ ] Improve interface of simple\_try(using macro?)
