Still in its early development stage

## Key features

* High speed and high fault tolerance(of player performance)

* Minimalist design(game mechanism and design style) 

* Randomly generated and reproducible(by u64 seed) enemies

* Time in game always synchronized: player will suffer, not benefit from low FPS

* Everything drawed, no resource file, replaceable GUI frontend

## TODO

### Implementation

* [x] Moving

* [x] Restrict position

* [x] Slowdown

* [x] Color and transparency

* [x] Antialiasing

* [x] World slowdown with transition

* [x] Simple cannon & simple bullet

* [x] Enemy path and graphics

* [x] Simple collision test with position(not tested!)

* [x] Collision box for enemy and player bullet(lineseg\_distance function)

* [x] Enemy cannon

* [x] Reproducible randomize cannon and bullet param(Framework)

* [x] Wave generator and wave manager
(add 1 wave type contains of 1 type of enemy with 1 type of cannon)

* [x] Player collision box

* [x] simple\_try random generator optimization with monotonicity

* [x] Enemy HP

* Add more resources

	* [x] New Cannon: Rotor with new bullet: RotateBullet
