### Implementation

* [x] Moving

* [x] Restrict position 

* [x] Slowdown

* [x] Color and transparency

* [x] Antialiasing

* [x] World slowdown with transition

* [x] Simple cannon & simple bullet

* [x] Enemy path and graphics

* [x] Simple collision test with position(not tested!)

* [x] Collision box for enemy and player bullet(lineseg\_distance function)

* [x] Enemy cannon

* [x] Reproducible randomize cannon and bullet param(Framework)

* [x] Wave generator and wave manager
(add 1 wave type contains of 1 type of enemy with 1 type of cannon)

* [x] Player collision box

* [x] simple\_try random generator optimization with monotonicity

* [x] Enemy HP

* Add more resources

	* [x] New Cannon: Rotor with new bullet: RotateBullet

	* [x] New EnemyPrototype: Medium

	* [x] New Cannon: Shotgun

	* [x] New Cannon: LaserLocker

	* [x] New path: wanderers

	* [x] New Cannon: Ring

* [x] Pause

* [x] WavePool

* Fix

	* [x] Fix lag decrease hit possibility
	
	* [x] Fix overlapping of waves

* [x] Player moves faster when not firing

* [x] Player hit reset

* [x] Path can stop enemy from firing

* [x] PlayerCannon2

* Game mechanism

	* [x] difficulty growth rate, start difficulty

	* [x] health recovery rate, full health

	* [x] slowdown time consumption and recovery rate

	* [x] difficulty increases slower when player health down

* Visual effects(Raw)

	* [x] Health display

	* [x] Slowdown display

	* [x] player being hit and reset cd

	* [x] Field background

	* [x] Slowdown background effect

	* [x] Destroy effect

	* [ ] Visualize difficulty

	* [ ] Hitboxes

	* [ ] fps indicator

	* [ ] Destroy can break line(?)

* Replay

	* [x] Replay

	* [x] Fast forward

* [x] Cannon groups(some cannons should not be generated on small ships)

* Sound effects

	* [ ] Audio backend and PCM buffer interface

### Performance

* [x] Split cannons file

* [x] Asynchronous wave generator

* [ ] Get fps above 40 in debug mode

* [ ] Parallelize

### GUI Graphics

* [x] Simple line and polygon drawing

* [x] Thick arc generator
