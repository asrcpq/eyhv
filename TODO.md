### Implementation

* [x] Moving

* [x] Restrict position 

* [x] Slowdown

* [x] Color and transparency

* [x] Antialiasing

* [x] World slowdown with transition

* [x] Simple cannon & simple bullet

* [x] Enemy path and graphics

* [x] Simple collision test with position(not tested!)

* [x] Collision box for enemy and player bullet(lineseg\_distance function)

* [x] Enemy cannon

* [x] Reproducible randomize cannon and bullet param(Framework)

* [x] Wave generator and wave manager
(add 1 wave type contains of 1 type of enemy with 1 type of cannon)

* [x] Player collision box

* [x] simple\_try random generator optimization with monotonicity

* [x] Enemy HP

* Add more resources

	* [x] New Cannon: Rotor with new bullet: RotateBullet

* Replay

	* [x] Replay

	* [x] Fast forward

* [x] Cannon groups(some cannons should not be generated on small ships)

* Sound effects

	* [ ] Audio backend and PCM buffer interface

### Performance

* [x] Split cannons file

* [x] Asynchronous wave generator

* [ ] Parallelize

### GUI Graphics

* [x] Simple line and polygon drawing

* [x] Thick arc generator
